0.5.4 - December 29, 2008
	
	Re-organized the main Solr adapters, they're now in Solr::Connection::Adapter instead of Solr::Adapter
	
	All responses from HTTPClient and Connection::Adapter::Direct return a hash with the following keys:
		
		:status_code
		:body
		:params
		:url
		:path
		:headers
		:data
	
	This hash is now available in the solr response objects as #source - this will be useful in testing and debugging by allowing you to see the generated params and queries... example:
		
		response = Solr.query(:q=>'*:*')
		response.source[:params]
		response.source[:body]
		response.source[:url]
	
	Added MultiValue field support in Solr::Message, thanks to Fouad Mardini
	
	Bug in Solr::Connection::SearchExt where the :q params was not getting generated - fixed by Fouad Mardini
	
	Organized tests a bit, moved connection tests into test/connection
	
	Fixed a bug in Solr::Connection::Adapter::HTTP where invalid HTTP POST headers were being generated
